## Objective

The objective for this project is to give the backend API I created previously a front end interface.

 I accomplished this by following Agile Methodology user stories to guide my development.

 I set out to Acheive the following:

        As a user I should be able to....

        - view a list of all articles.
        - view a page for each topic with a list of related articles.
        - view an individual article.
        - view an individual article's comments.
        - vote on an article and immediately see the change.
        - post a new comment to an existing article (as a default logged in user).
        - sort articles by: 
            - date created 
            - comment_count
            - votes
        - delete my own comments
        - use the site on my mobile without sacrificing style or functionality
